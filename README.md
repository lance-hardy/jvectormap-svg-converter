History

G5 has been using a custom widget featuring a JQVMap of the United States. Two "features" have been consistently requested which they were unable to implement.

- only show portions of the United States map (i.e., West Coast only, Midwestern States only, etc)
- in addition to the United States add all or a set of Canadian Provinces
